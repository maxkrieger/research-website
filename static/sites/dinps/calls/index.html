  <p>
With the emergence of the Web3.0 paradigm as well as the increasing exploration of naturally decentralized computation paradigms as in edge computing, 
    decentralized systems are becoming increasingly relevant. This field is thriving thanks to recent technological advances demonstrating the feasibility of
    decentralized systems at scale. Existing approaches include blockchain-based systems as well as systems like the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), 
    a peer-to-peer, content-addressable hypermedia protocol that seeks to connect all computing devices within a single distributed system of files. 
    IPFS is additionally complemented by Filecoin, a token-based protocol that supports an incentivized, decentralized storage and delivery network, among others. 
    These projects are open-source and community-driven with reference implementations in multiple languages and a global community of millions of users.
  </p>
  <p>
This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fields of decentralized systems, peer-to-peer networks, and edge computing. 
    Now is the time to leverage our expertise and discoveries in this area to define the future of the decentralized Internet: this includes work on underlying
    technologies and protocols, emerging standards, tools and abstractions (such as the ones provided by <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://libp2p.io">libp2p</a> and <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>), and also emerging applications and use-cases.
  </p>
  <p>
The workshop will consist of a number of different sessions and session styles that go beyond the traditional presentation-centric workshop. We seek to foster 
    interaction between participants with hands-on sessions that will give them first-hand knowledge of how to use IPFS and Filecoin and interact with these
    technologies, as well as ecosystem project platforms. A capstone competition will give attendees the chance to develop open-source applications and win prizes.
  </p>
  <p>
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Architectural proposals for the advancement of the state of decentralized Internet services</li>
    <li>Decentralized and peer-to-peer protocols and applications</li>
    <li>Edge computing —  with emphasis on decentralized solutions for the far edge and their integration with current Internet architectures</li>
    <li>Design, implementation, and evaluation of decentralized, networked systems and CDNs</li>
    <li>Socio-economic, legal, and/or regulatory aspects of content-addressable, permissionless, P2P networks</li>
    <li>Privacy and security of decentralized storage and delivery systems</li>
    <li>Applications that build on top of decentralized network storage and retrieval protocols</li>
    <li>Measurement studies on decentralized and edge computing infrastructures</li>
    <li>Improvements to the IPFS protocol stack, libp2p, or the Filecoin storage and (especially) retrieval protocol from a performance, privacy, or security perspective</li>
    <li>Cross-layer optimization between network- and decentralized service/application-layer protocols (e.g., consensus, pubsub, etc)</li>
    <li>Pubsub protocol performance and security improvements for decentralized, blockchain-based systems (e.g., Gossipsub)</li>

  </ul>
  <p>
    Accepted contributions will be given a presentation slot at the workshop and at least one author should show up (virtual participation will be considered, pending COVID-19 developments and IEEE ICDCS guidelines).
     The submissions format is flexible, ranging from 2-page demo and tutorial proposals to short 6-page double-column papers.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Work-in-progress papers</strong> (limited to 6 pages) presenting early findings and visionary protocol development directions.</li>
    <li><strong>Demos</strong> (limited to 2 pages) showcasing a proof-of-concept prototype.</li>
    <li><strong>Tutorials</strong> (up to 2 pages description) which will be part of the hands-on session to demonstrate emerging technologies or applications to build and deploy decentralized systems. 
      Tutorials are expected to last up to 45 min.</li>
    <li><strong>Competition project ideas</strong> (limited to 1 page) to be included in the 3-week post-workshop competition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Important Dates</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Submission Deadline: 5 March 2022</strong></li>
    <li>Acceptance Notification: 5 April 2022</li>
    <li>Camera-ready Deadline: 21 April 2022</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Submission Information</h4>
  <p> 
  Submitted papers should follow the formatting indications of the main conference: https://icdcs2022.icdcs.org/cfp/. In particular:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Papers must be original and unpublished, and must not be submitted for publication elsewhere concurrently.</li>
    <li>All paper submissions should follow the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ Two-Column Format</a>.</li>
    <li>Each submission can have up to 6 pages (including references) with the option of an extra 2 pages at the cost of 100USD per page. Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be rejected without review.</li>
    <li>The submitted manuscripts should include author names and affiliations.</li>
    <li>Each accepted paper must have at least one author registered and be presented during the conference. No-show paper will be reported to the publisher and deleted from the conference publication.
    <li>For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.</li>
    <li>Remote participation to the workshop is fine in case there are pandemic-related or other exceptional issues related to travel. However, participants should still register at the in-person rate.
