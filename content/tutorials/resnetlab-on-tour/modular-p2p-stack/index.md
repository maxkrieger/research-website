libp2p is the  Web 3.0 framework of choice for decentralised process addressing. In this module, you will hear about libp2pâ€™s modular and composable building blocks for P2P networking applications and innovation, which include:

  - Transport and pubsub protocols
  - Multiplexers
  - Secure channels and NAT Traversal
  - Peer discovery, content routing, and peer routing
