The purpose of Filecoin Research is to design the building blocks enabling Filecoin: a decentralized storage network. The group works on four main topics:

 - Consensus: The Filecoin consensus layer and precise constructions Filecoin uses or could use.
 - Protocol improvements: The transaction layer of the Filecoin protocol and cross-layer interactions.
 - Blockchain infrastructure: State of the art of generic blockchain constructions.
 - Cryptographic primitives: Performance and security of cryptographic primitives.
