The group works on four main topics:

 - Consensus: the Filecoin consensus layer and precise constructions Filecoin uses or could use.
 - Protocol improvements: the transaction layer of the Filecoin protocol and cross-layer interactions.
 - Blockchain infrastructure: state of the art of generic blockchain constructions.
 - Cryptographic primitives: performance and security of cryptographic primitives.
