The purpose of Filecoin Research is to design the building blocks enabling Filecoin: a decentralized storage network. We work to prove Filecoin constructions correct, or to improve them.

The group works on four main topics:
 - Consensus: This focus addresses the Filecoin consensus layer broadly. It encompassed projects dealing with precise constructions Filecoin uses or could use (like Expected Consensus or Single Secret Leader Election) as well as the broader classification of Storage-Power-based Consensus in the field, for instance in relation to PoW and PoS.
 - Protocol improvements: This area deals with the transaction layer of the Filecoin protocol and encompasses endeavours across the various parts that come together to make up Filecoin, including mining, repair, security, and storage.
 - Blockchain infrastructure: We plan to improve the state of the art of generic blockchain constructions.
 - Cryptographic primitives: Filecoin relies on the performance and security of cryptographic primitives. Our endeavours include Proof of Replication (PoRep), Proof of SpaceTime (PoST), SEALSTACK, SNARKs, and VDFs.
