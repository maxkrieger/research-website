A resilient system or network is fundamentally uncompromised by an isolated failure or network split. The system is malleable, adaptable to different conditions and capable of evolving to meet new requirements over time. The mission of the Resilient Networks Lab is to build resilient distributed systems by creating and operating a platform where researchers can collaborate openly and asynchronously.
