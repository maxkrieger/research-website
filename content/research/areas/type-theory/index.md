A long-term goal for the IPFS ecosystem is to merge distributed apps and local apps into a single paradigm: fundamentally rethinking the UNIX programming model for a content-addressable platform. As a component of this, we aspire to make the best use of state-of-the-art advances in programming language design and implementation, e.g. substructural types, modal types, and algebraic effects. In the near term, weâ€™re particularly interested in composable concurrent data structures, such as conflict-free replicated data types, and their interplay with trustless systems and distributed computation.
