The publish-subscribe paradigm is a wildly popular
form of communication in complex distributed systems. The properties 
offered by it make it an ideal solution for a multitude of
applications, ranging from social media to content streaming and
stock exchange platforms. Consequently, a lot of research exists
around it, with solutions ranging from centralised message brokers,
to fully decentralised scenarios (peer to peer).
Within the pub-sub realm not every solution is the same of course
and trade-offs are commonly made between the ability to distribute
content as fast as possible or having the assurance that all the
members of the network will receive the content they have subscribed
to. Delivery guarantees is something quite common within the area
of centralised pub-sub solutions, there is, however, a clear lack
of decentralised systems accounting for this. Specifically, a reliable
system with the ability to provide message delivery guarantees and,
more importantly, persistence guarantees. To this end, we present
Pulsarcast, a decentralised, highly scalable, pub-sub, topic based
system seeking to give guarantees that are traditionally associated
with a centralised architecture, such as persistence and eventual
delivery guarantees.
The aim of Pulsarcast is to take advantage of the network
infrastructure and protocols already in place. Relying on a structured
overlay and a graph based data structure, we build a set of
dissemination trees through which our events will be distributed.
Our work also encompasses a software module that implements
Pulsarcast, with our experimental results showing that is a viable
and quite promising solution within the pub-sub and peer to peer
ecosystem.
