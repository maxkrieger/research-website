abstract = {Flooded by the propagation of false or biased news in the Web, people tend to resort
to social networks to read posts from reliable sources, exchange commentaries with
trustworthy parties, access first-hand content, or cross-check information that appears
in news outlets. However, platform providers like Facebook or Twitter can ultimately
decide about the contents exposed to each user. Anecdotal evidence suggests that such
platform providers are prone to pressure by political or economical agents, and may
be ideologically driven to hide messages or block certain users [2, 12] thereby impairing
users' ability to freely access rightful information.},
