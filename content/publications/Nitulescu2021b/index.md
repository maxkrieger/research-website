Oblivious Polynomial Evaluation (OPE) schemes are interactive protocols between a
sender with a private polynomial and a receiver with a private evaluation point where the receiver
learns the evaluation of the polynomial in their point and no additional information. They are used
in Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocols.

We introduce a scheme for OPE in the presence of malicious senders, enforcing honest sender
behavior and consistency by adding verifiability to the calculations. The main tools used are FHE for
input privacy and arguments of knowledge for the verifiability property. MyOPE deploys sublinear
communication costs in the sender’s polynomial degree and one to five rounds of interaction.
In other words, it can be used as a verifiable computation scheme for polynomial evaluation over
FHE ciphertexts. While classical techniques in pairing-based settings allow generic succinct proofs
for such evaluations, they require large prime order subgroups which highly impact the communication complexity, and prevent the use of FHE with practical parameters. MyOPE builds on generic
secure encodings techniques that allow composite integers and enable real-world FHE parameters
and even RNS-based optimizations. It is best adapted for the unbalanced setting where the degree
of the polynomial and the computing power of the sender are large.

MyOPE can be used as a building block in specialized two-party protocols such as PSI (this usecase is hereafter described), oblivious keyword search, set membership and more using the OPE
instantiation.

As another contribution, our techniques are generalized to applications other than OPE, such as
Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR), to make them secure against a malicious sender.
