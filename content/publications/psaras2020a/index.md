Traversing NATâ€™s remains a big issue in P2P networks, and many of
the previously proposed solutions are incompatible with truly 
decentralised emerging applications. Such applications need a 
decentralised NAT traversal solution without trusted centralised servers.

In this paper we present a decentralised, relay-based NAT traversal 
system, where any reachable node is able to assist an unreachable
node in NAT traversal. Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
are used to ensure fair rewards. Besides !nancial incentives, a 
reputation system based on transactions on-chain is used to mitigate
against malicious behaviour, and guide peer discovery.

Evaluation of our system shows that a combination of historic
performance metrics leads to an optimal scoring function, that the
system takes little time to reach stability from inception, and that
the system is resilient against various attacks. Implementation of the
smart contract shows that the cost for participants is manageable.
