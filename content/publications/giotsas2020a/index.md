The Tier-1 ISPs have been considered the Internet’s backbone
since the dawn of the modern Internet 30 years ago, as they
guarantee global reachability. However, their influence and
importance are waning as Internet flattening decreases the
demand for transit services and increases the importance of
private interconnections. Conversely, major cloud providers –
Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft– are gaining in importance
as more services are hosted on their infrastructures. They ardently
support Internet flattening and are rapidly expanding their
global footprints, which enables them to bypass the Tier-1 ISPs
and other large transit providers to reach many destinations.

In this paper we seek to quantify the extent to which the
cloud providers’ can bypass the Tier-1 ISPs and other large transit
providers. We conduct comprehensive measurements to identify
the neighbor networks of the major cloud providers and combine
them with AS relationship inferences to model the Internet’s
AS-level topology to calculate a new metric, hierarchy-free
reachability, which characterizes the reachability a network can
achieve without traversing the networks of the Tier-1 and Tier-2
ISPs. We show that the cloud providers are able to reach over 76%
of the Internet without traversing the Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs, more
than virtually every other network.
