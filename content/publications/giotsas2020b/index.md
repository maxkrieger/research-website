Many systems rely on traceroutes to monitor or characterize the
Internet. The quality of the systemsâ€™ inferences depends on the
completeness and freshness of the traceroutes, but the refreshing
of traceroutes is constrained by limited resources at vantage points.
Previous approaches predict which traceroutes are likely out-ofdate in 
order to allocate measurements, or monitor BGP feeds for
changes that overlap traceroutes. Both approaches miss many path
changes for reasons including the difficulty in predicting changes
and the coarse granularity of BGP paths.

This paper presents techniques to identify out-of-date traceroutes 
without issuing any measurements, even if a change is not
visible at BGP granularity. We base our techniques on two observations. 
First, although BGP updates encode routes at AS granularity,
routers issue updates when they change intra-domain routes or
peering points within the same AS path. Second, route changes
correlate across paths, and many publicly available traceroutes
exist. Our techniques maintain an atlas of traceroutes by monitoring 
BGP updates and publicly available traceroutes for signals to
mark overlapping atlas traceroutes as stale. We focus our analysis
of traceroute path changes at the granularity of border router IPs
which provides an abstraction finer than AS- or PoP-level but is
not affected by the periodicity of intra-domain load balancers. Our
evaluation indicates that 80% of the traceroutes that our techniques
signal as stale have indeed changed, even though the AS hops remained 
the same. Our techniques combine to identify 79% of all
border IP changes, without issuing a single online measurement.
