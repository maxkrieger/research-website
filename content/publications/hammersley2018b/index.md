There are thousands of smart grid pilot projects all around the world, having begun largely in the
early 2000s. With the introduction of blockchain, and with the grid becoming more unpredictable
and decentralized, several use cases are becoming apparent for blockchain. This report points
to work that has already been done on Smart Grids -- particularly in the United States and
Europe -- as well as to several blockchain projects underway. The space is quickly becoming
saturated, with over 120 blockchain companies as of mid 2018.
