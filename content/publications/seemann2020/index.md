We present QuicInteropRunner [1,2], a test framework for automated and on-demand interoperability testing between implementations of the QUIC protocol [3]. We describe the key constraints and insights that defined our work, the recent innovations that made the framework possible, a high-level overview of our design, and a few exemplary tests. QuicInteropRunner is now supported and used by ten QUIC implementations as part of their development process, confirming our thesis that there is a need for automating interoperability testing and making it available on demand.
