In this document we aim to evaluate how VDF algorithms based on physical limits can be implemented in satellites and which physical properties / or roles of physics we can utilize to guarantee the passage of time. The goal of this study is to perform principal system analysis, identify main issues and risks, propose a path for derisking and come up with a budget and timeline for a suitable satellite (or satellite constellation).
