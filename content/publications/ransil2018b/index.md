This report focuses on power distribution and retail — the ‘last few miles’ of electricity delivery — because this portion of the power grid in particular must be transformed if we are to decarbonize our energy system. Compared to transmission networks, today’s distribution system is less sophisticated and less well monitored. However, it is the distribution system that will ultimately need to mediate the transition to a cleaner, decentralized energy future. Innovation towards a smarter and more flexible distribution system will thus be central to our efforts.
