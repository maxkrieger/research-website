Did you know Filecoin is the largest zk-SNARK network deployed to date? For the past two years we have been working on bringing zk-SNARKs to the world and to the Filecoin Network. While this journey is far from over, we wanted to give you a peak at where we are today.

zk-SNARKs are a cryptographic technique that allows a prover to efficiently convince verifiers that the prover knows some piece of information without revealing the information itself. This enables secure and private interaction in a blockchain setting. The efficiency of zk-SNARKs is a key property, and one that allow us to prove the validity of storage in much less space than would otherwise be possible.

Today, we present to you the beautiful [zk-SNARKs for the world minisite](../../../sites/snarks/), which showcases the use of SNARKs in Filecoin and some of the key improvements that allowed us to scale to this level. Enjoy the website!
