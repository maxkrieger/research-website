Since the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) was first introduced in a [2014 whitepaper](https://github.com/ipfs/papers/raw/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf), interest from the research community on improving and building on its protocol stack has been steadily growing. [A search for “IPFS networking” on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=ipfs+networking&btnG=) now returns over 1500 results, and that is just a fraction of the relevant publications. However, to this day, there has been no forum for researchers and academics working in this space to present their work and exchange ideas.

That is about to change! Working alongside a number of researchers in academia and industry around the world, we’re happy to announce that we’ll be co-hosting a workshop on decentralising the Internet, with a focus on IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and IPLD.

The workshop, titled [*“Decentralising the Internet with IPFS and Filecoin” (DI2F)*](https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/di2f-decentralising-the-internet-with-ipfs-and-filecoin) will be hosted  at IFIP Networking 2021, a top academic conference in networking research, which will take place during 21-24 June.

The programme and structure of the workshop are a little different to traditional academic workshops and intended to serve different communities. It will include:
- Paper presentation sessions, for which we’re calling on experts in the field to submit work-in-progress papers, demos, and abstract or position papers advancing new ideas, both relating to the IPFS stack and broader decentralisation field.
- A tutorial session to introduce the IPFS stack for those new to it, which will be a great way to get  ready for the rest of the workshop.
- A hands-on session where theory from the tutorial session will become practice and participants can get to know the ins and outs of the existing tools or extend a project they have been working on.

The workshop will finish with a Call for Hacks, which will run for two weeks following the event , followed by a separate gathering to announce the winners and awards.

The call for papers, demos, and competition projects is open until *19 March*. To learn more and submit, *check out the [Call for Contributions in the IFIP Networking 2021 website](https://networking.ifip.org/2021/workshops/di2f-decentralising-the-internet-with-ipfs-and-filecoin)*.
