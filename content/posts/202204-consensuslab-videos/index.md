Do you ever wonder what [ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab) is up to? If so, you're in for a treat!

Ever since our launch in July '21, we've been sharing our work with the broader community -- one of our very first initiatives was organising [ConsensusDays](/sites/consensusday21/). But, in 2022, we're becoming more intentional about working *in* public.

You can read about a lot of our recent work in this very website, such as our recent [paper](/publications/hierarchical-consensus-a-horizontal-scaling-framework-for-blockchains/), [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7d5KNRZdp0&list=PLhuBigpl7lqtqT8HLuk0mLVeG76Koa9St&index=11), and [blog post](/blog/2022/scaling-blockchains-with-hierarchical-consensus/) on hierarchical consensus. But that's just a small sample. Last week, we launched a new [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhuBigpl7lqtqT8HLuk0mLVeG76Koa9St) and published the recordings of our team week for the first time (you'll find a short summary [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF8UIwOhHBw&list=PLhuBigpl7lqtqT8HLuk0mLVeG76Koa9St&index=17)). If you head on to that playlist, you'll also see a number of our other talks, as well as the project demos that we do about every month.

This is still all rather passive and retrospective. But you're also invited to interact with us on ongoing work, future ideas, and random discussions. On our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/), you'll find tracking issues for each project -- these not only link to all the relevant resources but now feature [notes from our weekly calls](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/5#issuecomment-1061277732). Have questions (or answers)? Post a comment on the issue, or come talk to us in **#consensus**, on the [Filecoin Slack workspace](https://filecoin.io/slack) -- we'll be happy to invite you to our next call. You'll also find our detailed [roadmap](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/consensuslab-60f84a7fa2395a0011e4134c/roadmap?invite=true) there, as well as the [code](https://github.com/filecoin-project/eudico/) we're writing. Oh, and we'll be organising further events this year, including a new edition of ConsensusDays, so stay tuned!

Would you like to see more? Do you have any ideas for how we can do it better? We're all ears. And we're also hiring Research Engineers and Research Scientists so, if you're passionate about consensus and about working in the open, [come and join us](https://protocol.ai/join/)!
