[ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab/) is pleased to welcome [Matej Pavlovic](/authors/matej-pavlovic) to the team.

Matej joins us from IBM Research, where he was recently doing research on [MirBFT](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/mirbft), among other topics in blockchains and distributed systems. Before that, he received his PhD from EPFL and his MSc from TU Wien.

We asked Matej about what brought him to Protocol Labs, the projects he'll be working on, and his thoughts on future technological developments:

**How did you decide to join Protocol Labs, and what are you working on?**

> I got to know Protocol Labs thanks to my mentor at my previous job who joined some time before me. The more I had read, seen, and heard about the company, their vision, technology, company culture, and exciting research problems to work on, the more I liked it. Having worked on consensus protocols for years, I even had the opportunity to continue developing my research project - a scalable, high-throughput consensus protocol.

**What research problems are you most interested in exploring?**

> I am very interested in the scalability and security of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus / total-order broadcast protocols. I would like to explore the trade-offs between their performance, security, resilience to various attacks, and other properties.

**What future technology are you most excited about?**

> Fusion energy and quantum computing.
