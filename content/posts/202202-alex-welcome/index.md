We are excited to announce that [Alex Terrazas](/authors/alex-terrazas) will be guiding and supporting [CryptoEconLab](/groups/cryptoeconlab/) as a Technical Program Manager.

We asked Alex about his journey to Protocol Labs, the CryptoEconLab projects he will be working on, and his thoughts about future technological developments:


**How did you decide to join Protocol Labs, and what are you working on?**
I was looking for an opportunity to work on something completely different from what I was doing.  I am currently trying to help  CryptoEconLab keep up with the many exciting changes that are occuring in the Filecoin Network and contribute my own ideas along the way.


**What research problems are you most interested in exploring?**

I am interested in the collective action of inidivudals.  I hope to eventually merge ideas from decision neuroscience and behavioral psychology into our current research.  I would love to build something that we haven't even thought of yet.

**What future technology are you most excited about?**

Brain-computer interfaces and virtual reality are two areas of technology that I have tracked for a long time.  I hope they finally reach their potentials.
