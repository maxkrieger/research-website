In the spring of 2020, as a rapid response to the COVID crisis, Protocol Labs launched an [accelerated grants program](/blog/2020/protocol-labs-launches-a-covid-19-open-innovation-grants-program/) to support open-source projects building tools to confront present and future pandemics. Within one month of launch, PL awarded a total of $200,000 to ten projects marshalling hardware, software, research, and community-building to fight COVID.

This research continues to bear fruit in spring 2021. Two of Public Inventionâ€™s [**VentMons**](https://github.com/PubInv/ventmon-ventilator-inline-test-monitor) -- a device used to test and monitor ventilators -- are [making a difference in India](https://www.pubinv.org/2021/04/26/impact-of-ventmon-in-india-from-taurus-medical-corporation/).

The [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org/) team continues to update the [VentMon design](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468067221000249) and explore new innovations in respiratory support devices: you can learn more about their current work (including a demo of the latest VentMon model T0.4) and the open-source medical technology ecosystem at [RespiCon 2021](https://www.pubinv.org/respicon/) on **28 May 2021**.
