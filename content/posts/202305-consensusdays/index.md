We're happy to announce the publication of the [ConsensusDays 23 programme](/sites/consensusday23/programme/). The workshop will take place 5-6 June in the 14:00-18:30 UTC period. 

We were again overwhelmed by the community interest, and many decisions ended up coming down to program limitations and session planning rather than quality alone. In a repeat of the 2021 edition, the number and quality of talk proposals led us to extend the event with a second day in order to accommodate more discussions. In the end, 20 submissions were accepted out of a total of 35. 

We are grateful to all authors for their submissions and to Alberto Sonnino, Alejandro Ranchal-Pedrosa, Alexander Spiegelman, Alysson Bessani, Arthur Gervais, Chrysoula Stathakopoulou, Duc Le, Ertem Nusret Tas, Giuliano Losa, Guy Goren, Henrique Moniz, Jiangshan Yu, Joachim Neu, Josef Widder, Lei Yang, Matej Pavlovic, Nenad Milosevic, Qiang Tang, Rati Gelashvili, Rodrigo Rodrigues, Sergio Mena, and Srivatsan Sridhar for their hard work reviewing the submissions.

In addition to the accepted submissions, the event will also feature invited talks from Aggelos Kiayias (IOHK)
and Zarko Milosevic (Informal Systems).

If you haven't yet, please [register](https://lu.ma/consensusdays23) to attend the workshop. We'll be sending videoconferencing links to registered participants shortly before the workshop. In the meantime, we also invite you to join us in Slack. Please [join our workspace](https://filecoin.io/slack) and head on over to the [#consensus](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/messages/consensus) channel.
