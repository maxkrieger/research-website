In less than two weeks, the Protocol Labs Network will be meeting in Lisbon, Portugal for [LabWeek22](https://22.labweek.io/), a decentralised conference and a first for us. [ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab/) will also be present, and we're organising our own event: the **[ConsensusLab Summit](https://www.consensuslabsummit.io/)**.

The summit will take place on the afternoon of 26 October and will see a number of talks from ConsensusLab researchers, on [topics](https://www.consensuslabsummit.io/schedule) ranging from horizontal scalability to novel decentralised services, as well as time for discussions and an evening happy hour.

While attendance is free and open to the public, capacity is limited and [registration](https://www.consensuslabsummit.io/register) is required. Register now to save your seat!
