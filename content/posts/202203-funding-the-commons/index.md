The Network Goods team at Protocol Labs recently held the second in a continuing series of events bringing together researchers and thought leaders to discuss novel experiments and future directions for funding our collective commons.

The [*_Funding the Commons_*](https://fundingthecommons.io/) series is intended to stimulate and showcase research and discussion about innovative funding methods for critical public goods and open-source networks. Over a two-day virtual summit held March 3-4, participants enjoyed presentations from researchers, inventors, and thought leaders in the network goods funding space, including Jaan Tallinn of  the  [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/) & the [Center for the Study of Existential Risk](https://www.cser.ac.uk/), Allison Duettmann of the [Foresight Institute](https://foresight.org/), Scott Moore of [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/),  and Tom Kalil of [Schmidt Futures](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/).


The themes of the March *Funding the Commons* workshop include:
-   the new paradigms for encouraging open-source innovation and the maintenance of critical projects
-   new systems-engineering approaches to incentivizing risky research
-   new incentives, mechanisms, and markets for funding public goods at scale, and 
-  new ways of coordinating alignment on ambitious research projects

 Presenters also shared updates on public goods funding and network funding experiments started following the [November 2021](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhuBigpl7lqtMdPkejuo3mHdLFX53ftXJ)  *Funding the Commons* workshop.
