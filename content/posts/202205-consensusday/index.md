After a wildly successful 2021 edition, ConsensusDay is back for 2022! The goal remains: *to provide a forum for the discussion of early-stage but high-impact research with scientific interest and real-world applications* and to build a community around it. This time, however, we'll be experimenting with a new format.

We're happy to announce that [ConsensusDay 22](/sites/consensusday22/) has been accepted as a workshop at ACM CCS 2022, a top conference in security. The workshop will take place over a full day (either 7 or 11 November; to be confirmed) in Los Angeles, CA, USA, and will have formal proceedings.

At this time, we invite you to submit your work-in-progress papers, position papers, and demos for presentation at the workshop. Be sure to check out the [call for contributions](/sites/consensusday22/calls/) for full details. The submission deadline is **24 June 2022**. If you have any questions, send us an email or come to #consensus in the [Filecoin slack](https://filecoin.io/slack).

We hope that the new format increases attention for the topic in the CCS community. We are hoping to be able to support hybrid/remote attendance, but a final decision on the format of the conference is yet to be made and the workshop will have to abide by it. We realise that this year's format may be less welcoming for some but, in the future, we intend to experiment with this, the previous, and other formats in order to be as inclusive as we can. We're also organising a mid-year virtual event in June, with more of an industry focus and talks from different projects. More information to come soon!
