After a wildly successful 2021 edition, ConsensusDay is back for 2022! The goal remains the same: to provide a forum for the discussion of early-stage but high-impact research with scientific interest and real-world applications and to build a community around it. This time, however, we'll be experimenting with a new format.

We're happy to announce that [ConsensusDay 22](/sites/consensusday22/) has been accepted as a workshop at ACM CCS 2022, a top conference in security. The full-day workshop will take place on 11 November in Los Angeles, CA, USA, and will have formal proceedings.

At this time, we invite you to submit your work-in-progress papers, position papers, and demos for presentation at the workshop. Be sure to check out the [call for contributions](/sites/consensusday22/calls/) for full details. The submission deadline is **24 June 2022**. If you have any questions, send us an email or come to #consensus in the [Filecoin slack](https://filecoin.io/slack).

We are hoping to support hybrid/remote attendance, but a final decision on the format of the conference is yet to be made and  workshops will have to abide by it. We realise that this year's format may be less welcoming for some but we're experimenting with a mix of formats to increase reach and inclusivity. We're also organising a mid-year virtual event in June, with more of an industry focus and talks from different projects. More information on that one to come soon!
