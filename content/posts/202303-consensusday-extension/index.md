We have already received a number of excellent submissions for [ConsensusDay 23](/sites/consensusday23/) but have decided to extend the submission deadline in order to accommodate several pending contributions. We will therefore be accepting submissions until the end of Sunday, 19 March, anywhere on earth.

If you have already completed your submission but would like to update it in the extra time available, the system remains open. If you have any questions, send us an email or drop by **#consensus** on [Filecoin slack](https://filecoin.io/slack).
