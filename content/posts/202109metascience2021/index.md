Protocol Labs Research is excited to announce that we will be participating in the [MetaScience 2021 conference](https://metascience2021.org/): a global virtual conference spanning two weekends, 16-18 September and 23-25 September, to connect the study of science across disciplines, methodologies, and regions.  PL Research has organized a symposium about [**the role of tools in accelerating scientific discovery**](https://metascience2021.org/events/the-role-of-tools-in-accelerating-scientific-discovery/) to take place on **18/19 September**.

There is an ongoing debate as to whether the pace of scientific discovery is slowing.  It may be that the increasing complexity of research at the scientific frontier creates a *perception* of decelerating scientific progress. Our panel will present and discuss the argument that our tools and incentive systems must be re-engineered to match the complexity of the scientific questions we face.


We'll introduce and discuss some current implementations of:
- Tools for discovering and mapping the knowledge frontier
- Tools for sharing the current position of the knowledge frontier in a discipline or suite of disciplines
- and tools for supporting, managing, and incentivizing research at the knowledge frontier


Our symposium includes researchers from academic institutions, not-for-profit research organizations, and industry R&D labs: 

- [Ben Reinhardt](https://metascience2021.org/speakers/reinhardt/) of the [Astera Institute](https://astera.org/) will start us off with a discussion of  institutional and legal structures as tools for accelerating invention and discovery.

- [Joel Chan](https://metascience2021.org/speakers/chan/) of the [University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies](https://ischool.umd.edu/) will present tools for creating, navigating,  and sharing composable modules of provenanced scientific evidence. 

- [Karola Kirsanow]((/authors/karola-kirsanow/)) will present some lessons we've learned at Protocol Labs Research about technological roadmapping as a tool for incentive alignment and managing information flows.

-  [Jungwon Byun](https://metascience2021.org/speakers/byun/) of [Ought](https://ought.org/) will discuss applying advanced language models to automate research workflows.

- [David Lang](https://metascience2021.org/speakers/lang/) of the [Experiment Foundation](https://www.experiment.foundation/) will round out the session with a discussion of prototyping new science funding models to accelerate research

The talks will be short — about 5 minutes — and we expect to have a lively discussion afterward. We hope that you will [join us at the event](https://metascience2021.org/register/)!
