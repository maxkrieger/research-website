[ConsensusDay is back](/sites/consensusday23/)! We're going back to our roots and organising a virtual event on 5 June 2023, in the same format as the 2021 edition.

That means we will not be publishing proceedings this year, and welcome both novel contributions and those under review or published elsewhere in the last 12 months. Be sure to check out the [call for contributions](/sites/consensusday23/calls/) for full details.

We invite you to submit your work for presentation at the workshop by the **15 March 2023** deadline. If you have any questions, send us an email or come to **#consensus** in the [Filecoin slack](https://filecoin.io/slack).
