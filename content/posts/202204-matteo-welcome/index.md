[CryptoNetLab](/groups/cryptonetlab/) is pleased to welcome [Matteo Campanelli](/authors/matteo-campanelli) to the team as a research scientist. 


Matteo previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Aarhus University (with Claudio Orlandi) and at the IMDEA Software Institute (with Dario Fiore). He received his PhD from the City University of New York, where he studied with advisor [Rosario Gennaro](/authors/rosario-gennaro).

He has already hit the ground running at Protocol Labs: he recently authored [*Witness-Authenticated Key Exchange Revisited: Improved Models, Simpler Constructions, Extensions to Groups*](/publications/campanelli2022) with Kelsey Melissaris and fellow Labbers [Rosario Gennaro](/authors/rosario-gennaro) and [Luca Nizzardo](/authors/luca-nizzardo).

We caught up with Matteo and asked about his path to PL and vision of the future:

**What brought you to Protocol Labs?**

> The possibility of making cryptographic research impactful.

**What future technology are you most excited about?**

> Computations and storage running on large highly decentralized networks with very weak trust assumptions (and potentially with privacy on top!)
