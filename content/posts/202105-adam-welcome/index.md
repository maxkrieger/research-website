We asked Adam about his journey to PL, the MetaResearch projects he will be advising, and his thoughts about future technological developments:


**How did you decide to become an advisor to PL?**

I decided to join PL through my involvement in long-term discussions with Juan, Evan, and others about accelerating science.

**What problems are you currently most interested in?**

- Developing increased capacity for research that is pre-commercial but involves systems engineering and team science

- Overcoming structural monoculture in scientific organizations

- The biology of aging

- The neuroscience and biotechnology underpinnings of brain computer interfaces

- The intersection of neuroscience and AI

**What future technology are you most excited about?**

I view many technologies as interconnected, but, basically, the convergence of information and biology.
