[CryptoEconLab](/groups/cryptoeconlab/) is please to welcome [Tom Mellan](/authors/tom-mellan) to the team as a research scientist. 

Tom has spent the last two years modeling infectious diseases at Imperial College in London. The  backbone of this research centered on the messy intersection of science, maths and policy, asking simple  questions like: _what’s happened and why?_, _what’s up next?_, and _how sure are we about that?_ Before that, he did computational physics and chemistry research at Imperial and UCL. Now he's excited to optimize the utility-generating economic protocols supporting the transition to web3.

We  asked Tom about what brought him to Protocol Labs, the projects he'll be working on, and his thoughts about future technological developments:

**How did you decide to join Protocol Labs, and what are you working on?**

**What research problems are you most interested in exploring?**

**What future technology are you most excited about?**
