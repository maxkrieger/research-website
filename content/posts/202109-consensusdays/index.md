We would like to thank all authors for the overwhelming response to the call for contributions. We are delighted by the quality and number of submissions received, which already required us to expand our review team.

Moreover, given the sheer number of submissions, and after surveying registered attendees, we have decided to extend the event with a second (half-)day. Accordingly, we are renaming the workshop ConsensusDay<b>s</b> 21, and it will now take place 6-7 October.

We will be busy reviewing papers over the coming days and plan to send out decision notifications by the end of next week. Shortly after, the program will be posted on the [ConsensusDays](/sites/consensusday21/) website and sent to registered attendees.

In the meantime, we invite you to [register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeySa1MHdLmB_VgJPrD0EIaJuCpK2fL6JVC_EBzNEV_KVZrcA/viewform) to attend this free virtual workshop, which is intended both as a specialised forum for discussion of consensus research and an opportunity to bootstrap a collaboration network involving ConsensusLab, academic and industry partners, and other open innovation projects, with the aim of building an engine for the decentralised web.
