Sarah joins us from the [Information Security Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/) at [University College London](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), where she did [research on consensus](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=06C63r0AAAAJ&hl=en) and worked towards her forthcoming PhD in Computer Science. During her studies, she collaborated with Protocol Labs and was also an intern at [Calibra](https://www.calibra.com/). Sarah is now part of the Filecoin Research team.

Here's what Sarah had to say:

**What path brought you to PL?**

I met people from PL when I was at [SBC 2019](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19), presenting one of my papers. We found out that we were working on very similar research projects and decided to start collaborating on those. The collaboration went really well; I loved the vision of the project and the energy of the team.

**What are you working on?**

I am working on the security of Filecoin's consensus protocol.

**What future technology are you most excited about?**

More than anything specific, I'm very interested to see in what ways new technologies could be applied to solve societal problems.
