[ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab/) are excited to welcome [Sergey Fedorov](/authors/sergey-fedorov) to the team!

Sergey joins us from NEC Laboratories, where he spent the last 5 years working on security topics, including blockchain technologies. Before that, he was a contributor to the [QEMU open-source machine emulator](https://www.qemu.org/), having worked on the topic across different companies.

We asked Sergey about his journey and what brought him to Protocol Labs, the projects he'll be working on, and his thoughts on future technological developments:
