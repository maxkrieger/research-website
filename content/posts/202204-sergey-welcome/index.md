[ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab/) are excited to welcome [Sergey Fedorov](/authors/sergey-fedorov) to the team!

Sergey joins us from NEC Laboratories Europe, where he spent the last 5 years working on security topics, including blockchain technologies. Before that, he was a contributor to the [QEMU open-source machine emulator](https://www.qemu.org/), having worked on the project across different companies.

We asked Sergey about his journey and what brought him to Protocol Labs, the projects he'll be working on, and his thoughts on future technological developments:

**How did you decide to join Protocol Labs, and what are you working on?**

> I learned about Protocol Labs at the [ConsensusDays 21 event](/sites/consensusday21/) and was deeply impressed by the company's profound vision, which resonates closely with my values and beliefs. I was particularly excited about the [vision and direction for ConsensusLab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJwPyo2c_7k&list=PLhuBigpl7lqsq-WnYIHmds7oSqULOQU4x&index=1) outlined by [Marko VukoliÄ‡](/authors/marko-vukolic/), and immediately realized that I could not miss an opportunity to join the team. I am most interested in the work areas of [consensus protocols](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/2) and [parallel execution](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/issues/1). This fits well my personal research interests and is a natural continuation of my prior experience in design and implementation of Byzantine fault tolerant replication.

**What research problems are you most interested in exploring?**

> I am mostly interested in designing practical, full-featured, composable, and configurable Byzantine-fault tolerant replication systems, as well as exploring clear and expressive ways to implement them. I am also enthusiastic about exploring alternative programming models for distributed computing.

**What future technology are you most excited about?**

> I believe that decentralized Byzantine-fault tolerant mechanisms will globally dominate in future computing systems and I am very excited about working towards that.
