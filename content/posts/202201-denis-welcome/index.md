We're excited to welcome [Denis Kolegov](/authors/denis-kolegov/) to the [ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab/) team, as our newest Research Engineer. Denis joins us after a diverse career in computer security, crossing Tomsk State University, F5 Networks, BI.ZONE and more.

We asked Denis why he decided to join PL Research, what he will be working on, and to share his thoughts about future technological developments:

**How did you decide to join Protocol Labs?**
> I have been interested in the topic of consensus and distributed systems ever since I read Martin Kleppmann's [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) book. When I found that there is a company that is going to build the core of the future Internet, I realized that I want to be a part of it.

**What problems are you most interested in?**
> I am interested in development of modern consensus protocols and frameworks for building secure distributed systems.

**What future technology are you most excited about?**
> Quantum computing, decentralized economy, and multi-party computation.
