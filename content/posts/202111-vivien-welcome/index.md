We are happy to announce that [Vivien QuÃ©ma](/authors/vivien-quema/) will be advising PL Research's ConsensusLab. Vivien is a Professor of Computer Science at [Grenoble INP](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/en) and a member of the LIG laboratory. He currently devotes his attention to Byzantine fault tolerance, multicore systems, and P2P systems. At ConsensusLab, he will first focus on parallel execution in WASM order-execute models.

We asked Vivien about the journey that brought him to PL, the projects he will be working on, and his thoughts about future technological developments:
