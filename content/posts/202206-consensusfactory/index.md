Are you interested in consensus and distributed system scalability? So are we!

That's why we're organizing [ConsensusFactory](https://consensus-factory.io/), a new virtual event that will bring together speakers from different blockchain ecosystems, who will present the scalability approaches they are exploring. This first-edition event will take place on 22 June, and (free) registrations are now open.

We are still finalising the schedule but, so far, we have confirmed speakers from Algorand, Ethereum Foundation, Informal Systems (Cosmos), IOKH (Cardano), and Protocol Labs (Filecoin). The event will be live streamed, with an open chat for Q&A and discussions among attendees and speakers.

We hope to see you there! Just [follow the link to register](https://consensus-factory.io/)!
