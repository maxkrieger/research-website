Reflecting on my time at Protocol Labs Research over the past five years, I can't help but feel grateful. What began as a journey into uncharted territories of start-up research evolved into an extended mosaic of happy memories.

Together, we pushed boundaries and explored topics far beyond our initial plans. We contributed to metaresearch. We launched a grants programme. We organised world-class research events. We supported critical COVID research. We amplified outstanding research in our long-running seminar series. We incubated and spun off research labs. We launched and maintained open-source projects. We published tutorials on scientific writing and distributed systems. We generated novel research and disseminated it through talks and papers. Though we didn't achieve everything we set out to do, every output remains a testament to our collective passion for research.

Yet our biggest accomplishment was bringing together a unique group of brilliant staff, advisors, and interns in an environment that would prove hard to replicate. While Protocol Labs Research may no longer exist as an organisation, its legacy lives on through the contributions of its members and the projects it nurtured. The spirit of innovation and collaboration it fostered continues to thrive within many [nucleated teams](https://protocol.ai/blog/pl-past-present-future/) in the larger [Protocol Labs Network](https://www.plnetwork.io/).

While this website will remain a repository of our work, this will likely be its last update. My heartfelt thanks to everyone who has been a part of this incredible journey.
