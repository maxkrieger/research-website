Protocol Labs is currently accepting applications for its Associate Research Program 
Manager (ARPM) ten week summer program (2021). The ARPM program is an opportunity for 
undergraduate students to learn to grow and support research programs, drive research initiatives,
and engage in meta-research analyses (researching high-level ways to improve
the efficacy and impact of research programs).

Running from late June to early September (exact dates negotiable by cohort), the ARPM 
program is a chance for early-stage researchers to explore alternative career opportunities 
within the research ecosystem and gain experience developing, executing, and evaluating a 
cross-disciplinary research program within a technology startup environment. ARPMs will 
learn how research labs are run and funded, how research consortia are established and 
coordinated, and how fundamental research relates to the development of practical 
applications. With the support of the research management team, ARPMs will also pursue a 
research project focusing on how to understand and improve the pace of scientific progress.

Many undergraduate (and even graduate) students in STEM are uncertain what career path 
they wish to follow. The ARPM program is an opportunity to explore a particular niche 
within research that has applications in academia, industry, and anywhere else research 
is conducted. 

You can read more about the ARPM program and apply
[here](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol/2839e68a-fd92-4c8c-8677-06c6f2e721c6).

To apply:

- Submit application with CV and cover letter [here](https://jobs.lever.co/protocol/2839e68a-fd92-4c8c-8677-06c6f2e721c6/apply)
- Have one letter of recommendation emailed to research@protocol.ai from the professional 
email address of your letter writer. Email subject should read “*ARPM Letter: applicant first and last name*”.

Both of these steps must be completed no later than 11:59pm, Pacific Standard Time (PST), 
on January 15, 2021, and decisions will be communicated on or before February 15. If 
you have any questions about the program, please email research@protocol.ai.
