[CryptoNetLab](/groups/cryptonetlab/) is excited to announce that [Dario Catalano](/authors/dario-catalano) will be supporting the team as a research advisor.

Dario is a professor at University of Catania, where  he investigates questions related to reducing the gap between theory and practice in cryptography, with a particular focus on developing advanced yet efficient encryption mechanisms and designing secure distributed digital signature schemes.

Dario was attracted to Protocol Labs Research -- and CryptoNetLab in particular -- by its interesting research questions, and will be helping the team to realize better cryptographic primitives for blockchain-related applications.
