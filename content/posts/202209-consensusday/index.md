Consensusday 22 is fast approaching! The workshop, which will be co-located with ACM CCS this year, will take place 7 November in Los Angeles.

We have another exciting programme for this edition, comprising 15 talks that cover assumptions, PoS security, leader election, performance, and more. Eligible papers will be included in the CCS workshop proceedings and made available in the ACM Digital Library.

The workshop programme is now available on the [ConsensusDay 22 website](/sites/consensusday22/programme/).

More good news: the conference has switched to a hybrid format, allowing for both in-person and remote attendance. [Registration](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2022/attending/registration.html) is now open for both modalities, and Protocol Labs will be sponsoring a limited number of student registrations -- if you're a student and keen on attending, just reach out to consensusday@protocol.ai and include your CV. See you there!
