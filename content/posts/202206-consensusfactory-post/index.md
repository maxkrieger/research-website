Last Wednesday, we hosted the first edition of [ConsensusFactory: Decentralized Reflections on Consensus](https://consensus-factory.io/), a new virtual event that brought together speakers from different blockchain ecosystems to talk about the scalability strategies each of their projects are pursuing.

Talks included:
- "[Welcome to ConsensusFactory](https://youtu.be/cqx__Tr9vDg)" - Marko Vukolić, Protocol Labs
- "[ABCI++: Evolving Tendermint’s Modularity](https://youtu.be/cAR57hZaJtM)" - Sergio Mena, Informal Systems
- "[Data availability commitments with distributed reconstruction thanks to 2d KZG commitments](https://youtu.be/4L30t_6JBAg)" - Dankrad Feist, Ethereum Foundation
- "[Hydra: Next Generation State Channels](https://youtu.be/U9wox4PnAC0)" - Arnaud Bailly & Sebastian Nagel, IOHK
- "[Hierarchical consensus: A horizontal scaling framework for blockchains](https://youtu.be/mw1pmzHe9ms)" - Alfonso de la Rocha, Protocol Labs
- "[Speculative Smart Contracts in the Algorand Blockchain](https://youtu.be/fIRu0FvEUwQ)" - Victor Luchangco, Algorand

The day closed with a panel bringing together some of the speakers and the audience, and appropriately titled "[Decentralized Reflections on Consensus](https://youtu.be/f7g67E5aRFw)". You'll find the [full playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhuBigpl7lqt1u31AXFIVttjYVS8X9fpO), and each talked linked from the list above.

If you can't get enough of consensus, note that the submission deadline for [ConsensusDay 22](/sites/consensusday22/calls/) has been extended to 1 July. There is still time to submit and join us in November at CCS. See you there!
