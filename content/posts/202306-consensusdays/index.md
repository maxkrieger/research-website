- 22 talks
- 35 submissions
- 231 registrations
- 347 members of the #consensus channel 
- 612 members of the ConsensusDays mailing list 
- 614 YouTube views of the raw streams

Today, we bring you the final news of the year: the edited talks are now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxN6L-h3wFfsRKLCj4I8xKeKjy9OL-EY6). The individual videos are also linked from the programme page.
