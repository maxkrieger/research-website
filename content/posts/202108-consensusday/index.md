It was only last week that we [announced the launch of ConsensusLab](/blog/2021/consensuslab-supercharging-our-consensus-research/), a new Protocol Labs research group focused on scalable consensus for decentralised systems. Looking to drive more focused research into the topic, we are now inviting you to participate in our first public event, [ConsensusDay 21](/sites/consensusday21/).

ConsensusDay will be a one-day virtual workshop, intended both as a specialised forum for discussion of consensus research and an opportunity to bootstrap a collaboration network involving ConsensusLab, academic and industry partners, and other open innovation projects, with the aim of building an engine for the decentralised web.

We welcome contributions in a flexible format (including preprints and talk abstracts) on a range of topics that comprises sharding, new consensus protocols, parallel execution, and more. **Submissions are open until 8 September 2021**.

For more information, head on over to the [ConsensusDay 21](/sites/consensusday21/) website, where you will find the full call for contributions and registration form. The event takes place on 6 October -- we hope to see you there!
