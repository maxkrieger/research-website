We are pleased to welcome [Lefteris Kokoris-Kogias](https://lefteriskk.github.io/) as an external collaborator on ConsensusLab projects.

Lefteris is an assistant professor at IST Austria, where he leads the [Secure, Private, and Decentralized Systems (SPiDerS)](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/kokoris-group/) group. He will be contributing his expertise to the design of highly scalable hierarchical consensus solutions, with fast intra-subnet finality and efficient cross-subnet transactions.

We asked Lefteris about his journey to this point, the projects he'll be helping us with, and his thoughts about future technological developments:
