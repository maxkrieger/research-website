The PL Research blog is home to news about our [software releases](/blog/2021/the-winding-journey-to-proofs-v8.0.0-and-beyond/) and [conference presentations](/blog/2021/decentralising-the-internet-with-ipfs-and-filecoin-di2f-a-report-from-the-trenches/), [deep dives](/blog/2021/snarkpack-how-to-aggregate-snarks-efficiently/) into our techniques and tech stack, [design reports](/blog/2021/designing-a-dataflow-editor-with-typescript-and-react/), and updates about our [new research initiatives](/blog/2021/consensuslab-supercharging-our-consensus-research/). 

Now we're adding a new type of of post to our blog stack: the microblog -- short, opinionated posts about topics related to science, technology, and [the science of science](/areas/metaresearch). 

Our first entry in the series is a post from Research Team Lead [Evan Miyazono](/authors/evan-miyazono/) on the future of the Metaverse: [A rebuttal to the Metaverse as a dystopia](blog/2021/a-rebuttal-to-the-metaverse-as-a-dystopia/).
