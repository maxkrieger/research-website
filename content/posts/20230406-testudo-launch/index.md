Testudo is a new open source SNARK system developed by Cryptonet that offers efficient proofs with smaller setups. It uses polynomial commitments and sumchecks to prove the satisfiability of an R1CS system, and applies several optimizations to reduce the trusted setup size, improve proving times, and achieve fast verification and small proof size.

The team is looking for engineers to help push the effort forward. Read more about the details [here](https://cryptonet.org/blog/testudo-efficient-snarks-with-smaller-setups)!
