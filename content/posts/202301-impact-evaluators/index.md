**TLDR:** Protocol Labs' Network Funding team is releasing a whitepaper on Impact Evaluators, a funding mechanism designed for nontraditional projects with high uncertainty and high upside. Our goal is to add structure to the ongoing dialogue and share practical implementation advice based on a year of experience. [The paper is available here.](https://research.protocol.ai/publications/generalized-impact-evaluators/)

## Brief Background

Over the last year at Protocol Labs we’ve dedicated the efforts of our Network Funding team to push forward innovation in the mechanisms by which public goods and commons are funded, allocated, and sustained.  One interesting concept that has caught on has been “Impact Evaluators”, a term coined by Juan Benet & Evan Miyazono of Protocol Labs, which leans heavily on concepts in retroactive funding from Optimism’s RetroPGF and Academics before.

The idea of rewarding projects based on a fixed payout schedule and repeated evaluation stems from the powerful incentives observed from the revolutionary blockchain technology. The novelty we propose here is a focus on and expansion of the incentive system beyond a blockchain.  

We at Protocol Labs believe that this mechanism offers a powerful solution to funding an important group of high-upside high-uncertainty public goods. Over the past 12 months we’ve 1) pushed forward our thinking on the theory of Impact Evaluators and 2) experimented with several smaller-scale Impact Evaluator tests:

### Consolidating our Impact Evaluator learnings

Due to the interest generated by events ([Funding the Commons](https://fundingthecommons.io/), [CryptoEconDay](https://www.cryptoeconday.io/)) and the community at large, we’ve seen an uptake in projects experimenting with implementing Impact Evaluators. To share our learnings and provide structure to the Impact Evaluator concept, we’ve written a whitepaper on Generalized Impact Evaluators. Our goal with this paper is to accelerate development of Impact Evaluator mechanisms by providing:
Standard language to define and construct Impact Evaluators
A framework to efficiently implement Impact Evaluators

The next steps for Protocol Lab’s Impact Evaluator efforts

Protocol Labs continues to scale up our deployment of Impact Evaluators and create a more robust basis of theory, which we will iteratively publish publicly.  Meanwhile, for a selection of other resources on Impact Evaluators and related topics, see the bottom of the article. We are looking to create an open source effort on this mechanism - if you are interested in contributing, join the Impact Evaluator Working Group Telegram [HERE]
