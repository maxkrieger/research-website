The [ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab) team is excited to welcome our first summer research fellows, who will be joining us at different times throughout the summer to work on some of our core research projects.

We asked our summer fellows about their paths to Protocol Labs Research, the projects that interest them most, and their thoughts about future technological developments:
