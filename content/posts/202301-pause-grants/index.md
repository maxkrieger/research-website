Over the past calendar year Protocol Labs Research has received many applications for Open Research Grants, totaling nearly $1 million USD. We have had the opportunity to collaborate with and support work of numerous researchers and institutions, and we would like to celebrate these successes while also announcing the pausing of our Open Research Grants program. 

The change to our grants program offering is the result of a temporary internal shift from funding academic-forward projects to other highly impactful projects and innovative research groups, which can be seen in our current offering of open Requests for Proposals (RFPs). We realize the current time is a difficult funding environment, and apologize for the unfortunate timing. While the Open Research Grants program is closing, Protocol Labs is still accepting proposals for two RFPs, [RFP-013: Cryptonet network grant](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-013-cryptonet-network-grants.md) and [RFP-014: Private retrieval of data](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-014-private-retrieval-of-data.md), in addition to [RFP-X](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants#rfp-x). 

Given our continuous interest in understanding the scientific process and how we can leverage our resources and expertise towards improving the research landscape, we will take this opportunity to reflect on how to better accelerate important research before reopening our offerings at a future date.  

## Background
The PL Research grants program launched in [April 2018](https://protocol.ai/blog/ann-research-rfp/) when [PL Research](https://research.protocol.ai/about/) was first announced as an established team within Protocol Labs. Though the team has since grown and changed as various Labs nucleated, PL Research still oversees the current grant offerings. Open Research Grants were added to grants offering in [August 2021](https://protocol.ai/blog/research-grants-launch/). The past year-and-a-half of receiving related proposals has been an exciting time and allowed labs to partner with researchers in various countries spanning five continents.

## Accomplishments
In addition to funding various research proposals we, under Protocol Labs, were a founding sponsor of the [Stanford Center for Blockchain Research(CBR)](https://cbr.stanford.edu/). CBR focuses on research closely aligned with some of our research labs and [Open Problems](https://github.com/protocol/research#open-problems). We encourage you to check out CBR’s seminars, conferences, and call for papers [here](https://cbr.stanford.edu/sbc23/).

## Current offerings
While we are scaling back in the total number of awards offered, we are thrilled to see what collaborations and research proposals come our way. 
 - [RFP-X](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants#rfp-x) will continue to be open for research projects not otherwise covered by open RFPs. The success rate for RFP-X applications is significantly lower and advised to be the path of last resort.
 - [RFP-013: Cryptonet network grant](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-013-cryptonet-network-grants.md) is accepting applications until 23:59 UTC on July 30, 2023, or earlier if allocated funding is exhausted. Applications are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Additional information about Cryptonet grants can be found [here](https://cryptonet.org/grants). We encourage you to visit #lobby in the [Cryptonet Discord](https://discord.gg/TmuyuvbyKM) if you are considering applying or have any questions.
 - [RFP-014: Private retrieval of data](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-014-private-retrieval-of-data.md) reviews applications on a monthly basis and is awarded in phases. Phase 1 will be open until 23:59 UTC on March 1, 2023 or earlier if allocated funding is exhausted. We encourage you to visit #private-retrieval in the [Lodestar Discord](https://discord.gg/lodestar-network-goods) if you’re considering applying or have any questions.

### Looking forward
We are excited to have the opportunity to continue supporting various talented researchers through our ongoing RFPs. Please submit your proposal using our application management system at https://grants.protocol.ai/ and reach out to research-grants@protocol.ai with any questions.
