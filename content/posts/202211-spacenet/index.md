For all of the past year, our team at [ConsensusLab](/groups/consensuslab) has been hard at work pushing the boundaries of Filecoin scalability, devising a framework for horizontal scaling that allows for the seamless spawning of interoperable subnets and a reference consensus algorithm to run those subnets.

We are pleased to announce that, as of this week, the first phase of the [Interplanetary Consensus (IPC)](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/blob/main/specs/hierarchical_consensus.md) project is available to the public, with the launch of the Filecoin Spacenet. Spacenet is a new test network for IPC, which will initially provide a platform for builders to experiment with [Trantor consensus](https://github.com/protocol/ConsensusLab/blob/main/specs/trantor.md).

FEVM support is expected in the coming weeks, unleashing the potential for novel applications and use cases that require lower latency than provided by Filecoin mainnet consensus. Subnet support will be added to Spacenet next year, enabling elastic capacity and paving the road for deployment in the main network.

Today, we invite you to visit our newly launched [Scaling Filecoin website](https://fil.space/), as well as the [Spacenet repository](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/spacenet). You can get funds from the [Spacenet faucet](https://spacenet.consensus.ninja/), in case you want to give it a try, and please [reach out](https://forms.gle/b1bKWonBEsnCS7pv8) if you'd like to get involved. Please come and join us on #spacenet ([Filecoin Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack)).

PS: If you'd like to learn more about IPC, Trantor, and the rest of our work, the [recordings from the ConsensusLab Summit](https://www.consensuslabsummit.io/videos) are now available.
