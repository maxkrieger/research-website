We are excited to welcome [Abby Silin](/authors/abby-silin) as a Research Administrator at Protocol Labs.  

We asked Abby about what brought her to Protocol Labs, the projects she'll be working on, and her thoughts on future technological developments:

**How did you decide to join Protocol Labs, and what are you working on?**

> I was drawn to how focused Protocol Labs is on educating people about web3 as a whole and bettering its environment. Everyone I spoke with seemed so excited about their work and what's to come. Protocol Labs struck me as a place which is not afraid of change or pushing boundaries. I'll be assisting with research collaborations and supporting various research-development goals.

**What research problems are you most interested in exploring?**

> I'm most interested in exploring distributed power systems and knowledge engineering.

**What future technology are you most excited about?**

> Decentralization and all that comes with it!
