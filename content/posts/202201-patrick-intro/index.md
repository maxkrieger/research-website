 We are pleased to introduce [Patrick Woodhead](/authors/patrick-woodhead/), the Technical Program Manager for the [Retrieval Markets](https://retrieval.market) initiative. Research into data retrieval systems will be  critical to the development of a CDN for Web3, and Patrick is helping to guide these efforts at Protocol Labs.

We asked Patrick about his journey to PL, the projects heâ€™ll be helping us with, and his thoughts about future technological developments:

**How did you decide to join Protocol Labs, and what are you working on?**

> My mind was blown when I first came across IPFS and so I kept track of the progress of Protocol Labs for some years before joining. Then when I heard about Filecoin, and read more IPFS updates like the integration with the Brave browser, I felt compelled to apply for a role!


**What problems are you most interested in?**

> Privacy Preserving technologies.
More recently, networking and distributed systems.


**What future technology are you most excited about?**

> Web3, Smart Contracts, DAOs, DeFi, MPC, ZKPs
