# Describe talk here
abstract: "In this talk, Protocol Labs Researcher Rosario Gennaro surveys some of the main results and approaches in the area of Rational Proofs, including a fascinating connection to Fine-Grained Cryptography (defined as Cryptography which is secure against adversaries that run in a fixed polynomial time, as opposed to any poly-time adversary) and discusses the main open problems."
