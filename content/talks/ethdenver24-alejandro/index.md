# Describe talk here
abstract: "We present F3, a finality component designed to bring fast finality to Filecoin. F3 leverages a novel consensus protocol, GossiPBFT,  that runs on the side and finalizes tipsets in tens of seconds instead of hours, while laying the basis for verifiable cross-chain bridging."
