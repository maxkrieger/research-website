# Describe talk here
abstract: "Protocol Labs Researcher Sarah Azouvi presents her research on Winkle,
which protects any validator-based byzantine fault tolerant consensus mechanisms,
such as those used in modern Proof-of-Stake blockchains, against long-range attacks
where old validatorsâ€™ signature keys get compromised."
