# Describe talk here
abstract: "Single Secret Leader Elections have recently been proposed as an improved leader election mechanism for proof-of-stake blockchains. However, the security gain they provide has not been quantified. In this talk, Protocol Labs research Sarah Azouvi presents a comparison of proof-of-stake longest-chain protocols that are based on Single Secret Leader Elections (SSLE)– that elect exactly one leader per round – versus those based on Probabilistic Leader Elections (PLE) – where one leader is elected on expectation."
