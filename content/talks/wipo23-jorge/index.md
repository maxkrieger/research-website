# Short abstract
# Describe talk here
abstract: "The way in which the development and commercialisation of the metaverse unfold may result in an open architecture for collaborative innovation and participation, or in a series of silos tightly controlled by a small number of commercial entities. But does the outcome even matter? And, if so, how can we shape it? We will briefly go over the implications for users, developers, and regulators, and the role that emerging standards might play."
