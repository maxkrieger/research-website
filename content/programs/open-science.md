Protocol Labs Research aims to be an open organization with no borders. We are transparent about what we perceive as problems, and we engage with the community in order to better define and, eventually, solve them. We are open about our [results]( {{< relref "publication" >}}) and strive to publish them in ways such that anyone anywhere can access them. Lastly, we are open about our implementations, which we release under a [permissive license stack](https://protocol.ai/blog/announcing-the-permissive-license-stack/).

Most of our research discussions take place in our projects' Github repos, which are listed [here](https://github.com/protocol/research).
