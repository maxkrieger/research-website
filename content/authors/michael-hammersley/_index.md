Michael is a Materials Engineer by training -- he helped develop a polymeric touchscreen with buttons that rise out of the surface at Tactus, and then ran failure analyses on the computers and electronic components for the Avionics department at SpaceX. He's currently researching how to decentralize the energy grid. In his spare time, he enjoys tinkering with small art  projects.
