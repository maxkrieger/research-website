Guy is a researcher who specializes in distributed computing. He designs distributed algorithms that focus on applying abstract concepts, such as knowledge and silence, to provide a better understanding of fundamental problems and the underlying workings of protocols. He received a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Technion (Israel), with Prof. Yoram Moses as his advisor. Guy joined Protocol Labs to contribute to the research on agreement mechanisms (e.g. consensus) and to help bring theory closer to practice.
