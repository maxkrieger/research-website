Abby created her own college major, choosing to focus on social media communication, the physiology of perception and art, and the environment. She joined the team after spending the past four years working in tech, growing pilot roles and improving internal communications and processes. In her spare time, Abby can be found cycling, hiking, running, reading, or making art.
