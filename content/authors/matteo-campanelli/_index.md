Matteo is interested in the science and applications of succinct cryptographic proofs (how can I convince you that I know a potentially huge---and potentially secret---piece of data with a very very tiny proof). 

He joined Protocol Labs in 2022. In a previous life, he had the privilege of being a post-doctoral researcher at [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk/) (with [Claudio Orlandi](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/)) and at the  [IMDEA Software Institute](https://software.imdea.org/index.html) (with [Dario Fiore](http://www.dariofiore.it/)). In 2018 his advisor, [Rosario Gennaro](/authors/rosario-gennaro), and the City University of New York made the careless blunder of giving him a PhD.

Matteo has a totally seriously-named [website](https://binarywhales.com).
