Yolan is an applied cryptographer delving into (and dwelling on) cryptography, secure coding, and other fun things. He has previously spoken at Black Hat USA, NorthSec, GopherCon, Real World Crypto and DEF CON on topics including automation in cryptography, public keys vulnerabilities, elliptic curves, post-quantum cryptography, functional encryption, open source security, distributed randomness, and more! He introduced the first practical fault attack against the EdDSA signature scheme and orchestrated the full disclosure with PoC of the CurveBall vulnerability. Nowadays he's working on the distributed randomness project, drand, studying pairing-based cryptography, distributed key generation, and threshold systems. His most recent work was focused around Timelock Encryption.
