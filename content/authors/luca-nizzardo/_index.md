I am a Cryptography Researcher at Protocol Labs, where I work on crypto-related problems involving Filecoin. Before joining Protocol Labs I did my PhD in Cryptography at Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies in Software under the outstanding supervision of Dario Fiore. I'm broadly interested in Blockchain related problems involving cryptography, like Zero Knowledge Proof Systems, Contingent Payments, Consensus Algorithms, Vector Commitment Schemes. Moreover, I have been working on cryptographic techniques for the security of the Cloud since 2014, with a particular focus on homomorphic primitives. Before starting my PhD, I have been a business intern at IBM Italy in the Global Business Services division (Fall 2013) and a visiting master student at City College of New York under the supervision of Rosario Gennaro (Spring 2013). During the Spring 2017 I was a visiting PhD student under the supervision of Rosario Gennaro at City College of New York.
