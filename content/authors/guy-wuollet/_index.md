Guy works on the networking aspect of cryptonetworks. He is particularly interested in building truly decentralized, secure, and censorship-resistant networking protocols for cryptonetworks. Guy previously worked at Andreessen Horowtiz and studied Computer Science at Stanford University, where he was also on the Varsity Rowing team. His other technical interests include computational biology, natural language processing, and quantitative finance. In his free time, Guy enjoys good food, great friends, and spending time with his two precocious puppies.

Fun fact: Guy first became enthralled with cryptonetworks when his grandmother asked for advice on buying Bitcoin.
