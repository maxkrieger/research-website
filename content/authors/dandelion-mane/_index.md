Dandelion (they/them) is a creature of unusual intersections. Born in America to an Israeli father and a Korean mother, they went on to study a mixture of philosophy, economics, finance, and computer science at the University of Chicago. When they joined Google Brain, it as a software engineer focused on the intersection of data visualization and machine learning. Now, at Protocol Labs, they are building SourceCred, which will create sustainable economies around open-source projects.
