Irene is an Italian cryptographer based in Switzerland. She completed her Ph.D. at Aarhus University (Denmark) in 2016 after her undergraduate studies in Mathematics at Pisa University (Italy). After completing her Ph.D., she was a research assistant (postdoc), first in the USA (Madison, WI) and then in Italy (ISI Foundation, Turin). Her postdoctoral work focused on privacy-preserving machine-learning. Her research interests lie in the area of cryptographic protocol design and in the intersections between cryptography and other fields such machine-learning and blockchain technology.
