Yann holds BSc and MSc degrees in Communication Systems with a specialization in cyber security from École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (Lausanne, Switzerland), where he also worked as a research assistant in the lab of Prof. Rachid Guerraoui. He is currently a PhD student at ETH Zurich in the Distributed Computing group of Prof. Roger Wattenhofer. There he works on designing distributed systems that are able to process transactions concurrently. He is also analyzing the potential and dangers of voting advice applications (such as SmartVote) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).
