Dennis has been a Research Engineer at Protocol Labs since 2022, living in Switzerland. He completed his Bachelor’s degree in extraterrestrial Physics and his Master’s in solid-state Physics at the [CAU in Kiel](https://www.uni-kiel.de/) before building the real-time event supply of the Daimler Mercedes Me backend at [freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/) in Hamburg. Now, he is working on his PhD in Computer Science at the Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen, combining formal physics education with computer science by performing measurements in decentralized, networked systems within [ProbeLab @Protocol Labs](/groups/probelab/). In 2023, Dennis received the Applied Network Research Prize ([ANRP](https://irtf.org/anrp/)) for his joint work on the paper [Design and Evaluation of IPFS: A Storage Layer for the Decentralized Web](/publications/design-and-evaluation-of-ipfs-a-storage-layer-for-the-decentralized-web/).
