Trent joined Protocol Labs in April 2021 after spending time working at Cornell University and helping develop the Smart Contract Research Forum. He received his MSc in Applied Economics and Management from Cornell, where he focused on consumer, agricultural, and development economics. Before starting graduate school, Trent spent two years living in the Peruvian jungle working with coffee and pineapple farmers to increase their access to markets. Outside of tech research, Trent is passionate about both sustainable coffee farming and wine production. Eventually he hopes to one day own and operate a coffee farm, but until then he is excited to push the boundaries of open source technology and research!
