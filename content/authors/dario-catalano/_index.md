Dario is a professor at University of Catania. Before joining the University of Catania as faculty member, he was a full-time researcher at the French CNRS. There he was part of the Crypto Team  at the Laboratoire d’Informatique de l’Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris for five years: one year as a postdoc, and four as a CNRS researcher.

Dario's main research interests are in the area of cryptography, and more specifically, on questions related to reducing the gap between theory and practice in cryptography.  His most recent works address the realization of advanced yet efficient encryption mechanisms and the design of secure distributed digital signature schemes.
