Tom is passionate about Bayesian statistics, interdisciplinary collaboration, and using math and computers to study humanity’s most interesting questions. 

Tom has research experience computational physics and chemistry, and he has worked at Imperial College on modelling infectious diseases from both from the policy-decision perspective and the fundamentals, e.g. stochastic processes with competitively-interacting dynamics.
