Cryptoeconomics is an emerging field of economic coordination games in cryptographically secured peer-to-peer networks. As an interdisciplinary study, cryptoeconomics involves a constellation of knowledge  including computer science, network science, statistics, economics and system engineering. In an increasingly networked and open world, cryptoeconomics will play a bigger role in coordinating human and machine activities and building a better future.

## Mission & Vision

CryptoEconLab at PL aspires to become a research hub for research on economic incentives, coordination games, and novel marketplaces. We aim to develop capacity to design, validate, deploy, and govern large-scale economic systems. CryptoEconLab strives to empower projects in the ecosystem through novel incentives and advance humanity’s understanding of multiagent systems and algorithmic steering of economic networks.

## Motivation & Description

The lab’s genesis comes from a growing need for the ability to design and deploy large-scale economic systems, from token networks to the Metaverse. CryptoEconLab is designed to take ownership of the economic aspects of a technosocial system including design, specification, validation, deployment, and governance.
