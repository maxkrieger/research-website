The Protocol Benchmarking & Optimization Team (ProbeLab) is on a mission to measure the performance of Web3 network protocols, benchmark protocols against target performance milestones, and propose improvements to their core design principles.

Our work focuses on internal network protocol logic, as well as cross-protocol interoperation and network architecture. We start from the protocol as an independent entity and dive into its mechanics. We then investigate the exogenous factors that influence the performance of the protocol, as well as the influence that this protocol has on other parts of the system. We specialize and work on network-layer protocols.
