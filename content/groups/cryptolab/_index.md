The purpose of CryptoLab is to develop and apply new cryptographic tools to secure computation and communication systems.  Much of the past and current work includes designing, proving, and improving the building blocks enabling Filecoin: a decentralized storage network.

Though the group was founded to drive the creation of Filecoin, it seeks to facilitate the development and incorporation of cryptographic tools to increase security and privacy of communication, and engender new capabilities.

Cryptolab's current focuses are:
 - Filecoin protocol improvements: This area deals with the transaction layer of the Filecoin protocol and encompasses endeavours across the various parts that come together to make up Filecoin, including mining, repair, security, and storage.
 - Blockchain infrastructure: We plan to improve the state of the art of generic blockchain constructions.
 - Cryptographic primitives for Filecoin: Filecoin relies on the performance and security of cryptographic primitives. Our endeavours include Proof of Replication (PoRep), Proof of SpaceTime (PoST), SEALSTACK, SNARKs, and VDFs.

Much of CryptoLab's work is exhibited in the Filecoin Research [website](https://research.filecoin.io/) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/research/).
