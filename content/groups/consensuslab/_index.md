ConsensusLab’s vision is to be the go-to place for scalable decentralised consensus research. In the true spirit of Protocol Labs Research, we aim to become a hub for the collaborative advancement of human knowledge on this challenging topic. Together with a wide network of academic and industry partners, and in collaboration with other open projects, our team will be building an engine for the decentralised web.

For more information on our problems of interest, projects, and other activities, check out our [landing page](https://consensuslab.world/) and the [protocol/ConsensusLab repo on GitHub](https://github.com/consensus-shipyard/consensuslab).
