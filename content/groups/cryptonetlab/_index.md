The purpose of CryptoNetLab is to develop and apply new cryptographic tools to secure computation and communication systems. Much of the past and current work includes designing, proving, and improving the building blocks enabling Filecoin, a decentralized storage network.

Though the group was founded to drive the creation of Filecoin, it seeks to facilitate the development and incorporation of cryptographic tools to increase security and privacy of communication, and engender new capabilities.

## How We Work

CryptoNetLab aims to function as a Public Good Cryptography Lab providing technological empowerment to the creators and users of Web 3.0 technologies. We prefer to work collaboratively in a distributed and permissionless fashion: a pass-through layer to cryptography research.

To that end, we are very interested in forming collaborations with researchers and engineers working in our fields on interest, and we offer several grants and research fellowships to support these working relationships.

## Research Endeavours

CryptoNetlab’s current foci are:
- **Cryptographic primitives**: Filecoin relies on the performance and security of cryptographic primitives. Our endeavours include Proof of Replication (PoRep), Proof of SpaceTime (PoST), SEALSTACK, SNARKs, and VDFs.

- 

Much of CryptoLab’s work is exhibited in the Filecoin Research [website](https://research.filecoin.io/) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/research/).
