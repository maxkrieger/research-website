The AbstractionLab houses several independent research projects directly exploring the future of decentralization and how infrastructure affects technological possibilities.

Formerly known as the Independent Research Group,  AbstractionLab is currently home to three projects scouting the frontiers of the adjacent possible.

## The Decentralized Energy Project

The [Decentralized Energy Project](/talks/decentralized-energy-grid-a-protocol-labs-independent-research-project/) is a collaboration with the [MIT Energy Initiative](https://energy.mit.edu/) bringing PL’s expertise in distributed systems to bear on the architecture of the public energy grid. Led by researchers [Michael Hammersley](/authors/michael-hammersley/) and [Alan Ransil](/authors/alan-ransil/), the Energy Project explores a potential evolutionary trajectory of grid infrastructure toward a decentralized system incorporating distributed energy generation. The project has formulated a functionally-defined, invariant architecture for the grid and is working with stakeholders in the energy  sector to evaluate potential directions inmicrogrid develpment.

## The Inter-Cranial Abstraction System

The [Inter-Cranial Abstraction System](/talks/the-inter-cranial-abstraction-system-icas/) is a framework for computable knowledge. The ICAS project, led by researcher [Alan Ransil](/authors/alan-ransil/), integrates applied category theory with dual-process theory to build a flexible system for computation over scientific datasets, with the aim of accelerating combinatorial knowledge generation.

## The Underlay

[The Underlay](/talks/the-underlay-a-distributed-public-knowledge-graph/) — a project developed by researcher [Joel Gustafson](/authors/joel-gustafson/) in collaboration with the MIT Knowledge Futures Group—aims to provide open access to humanity’s knowledge in a distributed knowledge graph while simultaneously tracing the provenance of each knowledge artefact.
