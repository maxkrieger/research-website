 ## Mission & Vision

> *We are a Research Development Lab focused on the intersection of applied cryptography, high performance computing, and programming language design. We strive to create and consume practical research to develop deployed software.*

## Motivation & Description

Seeded by the hard problems Filecoin Mainnet presented, our long-term vision is to build on the solutions discovered and bring them to maturity. In this way, we will address a broader range of general problems, while discovering and overcoming new hard research development challenges along the way. Our aspiration is to harness this ongoing feedback loop to make ever more ambitious computational techniques practical for real-world applications.
