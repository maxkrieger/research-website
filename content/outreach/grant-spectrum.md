The Protocol Labs Research Grant Program aims to support collaborative work on problems defined by the broader research community. We encourage proposals aligned with PL's mission to drive breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward, and we welcome unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds.

Grant applications can be submitted at any time. Evaluation of
applications will occur in two rounds: one for applications received on or before **the second Thursday of April**, and a second round for applications received on or before **the second Thursday of September**. Decisions will normally be made and communicated to applicants within four weeks of these submission deadlines.
