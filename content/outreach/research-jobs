The mission of Protocol Labs Research is to pursue open, collaborative, high-impact 
research that pushes the boundaries of what computing can do for humanity, and we are looking for
people who share this vision and are willing to work hard to get there. As a distributed team, 
we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff). 
We look for people with unique perspectives and diverse backgrounds.
