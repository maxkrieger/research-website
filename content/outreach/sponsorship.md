We support conferences, workshops and events that are directly aligned with the mission and values of PL research. These sponsorships support open source collaboration and innovation, further the visibility and impact of PL research, and strengthen relationships between PL and other open source communities. Our current sponsorship process is undergoing revision, at the completion of which, we will begin taking open requests for sponsorship.
