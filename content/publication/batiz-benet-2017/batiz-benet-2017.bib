 abstract = {Blockchain protocol tokens, or simply "tokens" are digital assets used in connection with decentralized services, applications, and communities (collectively, "token networks"). As of this writing, dozens of such networks are in use worldwide , with many more in development. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most notable examples. Token networks may bring about positive paradigm shifts to computing, finance, law, government, and more. Tokens leverage computation and cryptography to represent consumptive goods (known as "utility tokens") or replacements for traditional investments (known as "securities tokens").},
