abstract = {The future decarbonized power grid will make increasing use of distributed energy resources (DERs) controlled using data collected at an extremely granular level compared to today's coarse bulk power system models. However, the centralized system by which security constrained economic dispatch is implemented at the transmission level cannot be directly applied to a distribution system comprising five orders of magnitude as many nodes engaging in complex scheduling and bidding behavior. Emerging data processing tools such as distributed state estimation algorithms, multiparty computation, blockchains, zero-knowledge proofs and machine learning hold the promise of collecting and processing the necessary data efficiently and securely. In particular, the implementation of transactive energy mirrors the decentralization of the world wide web from a data processing perspective, with similar toolsets required to develop secure, robust algorithmic markets making personalized decisions based on locally relevant datasets. The development of cryptographic tools and data processing infrastructure to build these decentralized markets is advancing rapidly. Meanwhile, capital must be deployed in},
