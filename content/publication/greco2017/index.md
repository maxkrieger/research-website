abstract: "How might we incentivize a peer-to-peer network to store users' files? The purpose of this research is to combine ideas from existing peer-to-peer file sharing systems, blockchain technology and Proofs-of-Storage to create an incentivized decentralized storage network, where every participant can earn a reward for storing and serving files or pay the network to store or retrieve their own. More broadly, in this thesis we present the elementary components for building decentralized infrastructure, culminating in a protocol for incentivizing file storage."
