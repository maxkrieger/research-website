Distributed systems are, broadly speaking, networked systems whose components are located in different nodes that communicate and coordinate to achieve the system's purpose. Distributed systems are at the very core of what we do and our interests extend across the entire field. In recent times, we have focused our efforts in the topics of consensus protocols, content-addressed networking, decentralized markets, distributed data structures, and distributed energy systems.
